Name of QuantLet : Best linear Model

Published in : 'Daniel Jacob - Fruehsignale fuer Aenderungen 
von Konjunkturindikatoren durch Analysen von Big Data'

Description : 'Finds the best linear model by choosing 
x regressors from an amount of n possible variables. 
It fits the regressors with the dependent variable 
and shows different quality criteria like R^2 and 
BIC-criteria. Additionally, it shows how to reduce the 
Google Correlate Dataset to deselect useless words.
In a further step a OLS regression summaries the results 
to give more information about the model. Additionally, 
it plots a Heat-map of qualitative regressors and 
a scatterplot with one selected regressor and 
the dependent variable.'
